My first MLP made with help from [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi), and [this book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html), and [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/math-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-d6da9f29ce65)

Originally I was working on creating a neural network that was structured a bit more like that in chapter one of the linked book, however, I felt that the book's method was somewhat confusing so I then remade my model to look more like that in the linked article. My original attempt can be found in the "Old" folder. 

Once I finish creating this simple MLP, I plan on attempting to attempt making a CNN which would be much more efficient and effective for image recognition compared to my simple MLP.
